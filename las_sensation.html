            <p>
                The 1860s was a decade marked by an infatuation of the public in all 
                matters <i>sensational</i>. Permeating throughout advertisements, journalism, 
                preaching, science, theater, art, and literature, it seemed that spectacle 
                and scandal were preoccupations which touched every aspect of Victorian life. 
                Perhaps best epitomized in the sensation novel, a categorization which 
                Braddon’s <i>Lady Audley’s Secret</i> helped to form and popularize, 
                the discourse of sensationalism extended to all manner of cultural productions 
                and became almost omnipresent in British society. During “the 1860s and into 
                the 1870s ‘sensation’ or ‘sensational’ were ubiquitous critical or descriptive terms”<sup class="note"><a href="#note1">1</a></sup> 
                which delineated the emotionally violent stimulation that accompanied 
                encounters of the sensationalist genre.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Characterized by spectacular popularity, the sensation novel grew out of 
                and alongside these other discourses of sensation that were found in a “wide range of 
                popular forms such as the Gothic novel, which flourished at the turn of the 
                eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Newgate tales of crimes and criminals, 
                penny magazines, broadsheet street literature, stage melodrama and sensational journalism.”<sup class="note"><a href="#note2">2</a></sup> 
                Sensation, in this sense, was not only present in the story lines of these novels, 
                which often featured bigamy, murder, deception, and other events of scandalous natures, 
                but also in their popularity. Linked to wider discussions of the public’s morality and 
                intellect, these novels participated in the age’s preoccupation with the enigma 
                of sensation in its ability to be widely and simultaneously coveted and criticized.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                The climate in which <i>Lady Audley’s Secret</i> would have been received was colored 
                by this on-going discussion about the merits and malignancy of sensation. Released on 
                the same day as the first issue of <i>Lady Audley’s Secret</i> in the <i>London Journal</i>, 
                the “Softening of the Brain” in <i>The Saturday Review</i> embodies a tone common 
                to sensation’s critique:
            </p>
            <br />
            <p style="padding-left: 25px;">
                The present craving for ‘Sensation’ has a very ugly look. The word itself is a kind 
                of confession of mental debility, insinuating as it does, that the powers of the mind 
                are useless for purposes of instruction or enjoyment, and that we must fall back upon 
                the senses. Can we have any doubt that the public brain is in a bad way, when we find 
                that it is incapable of relishing anything that is not flavoured by this unhealthy 
                stimulus?...it is present in everything we take up…In fiction, it has raised to the full 
                rank and dignity of a novel the sort of tale that used to appear, adorned with hideous 
                woodcuts, in the columns of the penny periodical…<sup class="note"><a href="#note3">3</a></sup>
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                As with this excerpt, “[t]he sensation debate and the sensation novel itself 
                were…the focus for a range of interrelated social tensions and anxieties… arising 
                from contemporary social changes and the attendant challenging and questioning of 
                the social and moral <i>status quo</i>.”<sup class="note"><a href="#note4">4</a></sup>
                The rise of sensation fiction to “the full rank and dignity of a novel” coincided 
                with fears of other sorts of mobility and change in the institutions of the family, 
                gender, and the social classes. Though the idea and allure of sensationalism was 
                not wholly new during this decade, it was the sensation of sensation itself 
                that reached new heights and imposed itself upon the cultural consciousness, 
                leaving lasting marks upon the realms of reality and fiction—it was “the Age of Sensation.”<sup class="note"><a href="#note5">5</a></sup>
