            <h2>Pre-Raphaelites and Print Culture</h2>

            <p>
                Metaphors of the visual arts are frequently employed to describe 
                literature—a writer paints a picture, they color a scene, sketch a 
                character, illustrate a dialogue. But, as has been noted, the 
                print culture of the nineteenth-century placed an even greater 
                premium on the interactions of the visual and linguistic arts 
                as illustration became intertwined with print and commonplace in 
                the production of the novel.<sup class="note"><a href="#note1">1</a></sup> 
                More than just the presence of visuality alongside textuality, 
                there were "a set of pictorial demands placed on novelists, 
                expected not only to be masters of the art of narrative but 
                also to be familiar with the visual arts…[and were] expected to 
                understand painterly techniques to such an extent as to be able 
                to employ them in their narratives or, even further, to transform 
                pictorial into narrative techniques.”<sup class="note"><a href="#note2">2</a></sup> 
                Such a requirement necessitated an awareness of the Pre-Raphaelite 
                movement for novelists of the nineteenth-century based on their 
                popularity and prominence, their predisposition to the art of the 
                visual and the verbal, and on their prevalence in the 
                world of print culture. 
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                The Pre-Raphaelites were renowned painters, but they were also illustrators 
                and worked in some of the most well-known Victorian periodicals of the day. 
                Frequently associated with the illustration of poetic works, the 
                Pre-Raphaelites also worked in novels. Their particular attention to the 
                intricacies of representation, their commitment to natural and truthful 
                portrayal of subject over idealized beauty coincided well with the 
                nineteenth-century novel’s realism, but even for works of sensation, 
                their principles encouraged the ability of illustration to faithfully 
                capture and portray the emotions elicited within the text. Where novelists 
                and their illustrators were tasked with painting a portrait of story, 
                the Pre-Raphaelite influence extended beyond these collaborative moments 
                and were, at times, infused into the world of the novel itself.

            <h2>Portraiture in Lady Audley’s Secret</h2>
            <figure>

                <figcaption id="illustration"><p>George Talboys contemplates Lady Audley's portrait.</p></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                In <i>Lady Audley’s Secret</i>, Robert Audley gazes upon a portrait 
                recently commissioned of Lady Audley and remarks:
            </p>
            <br />
            <p style="padding-left: 25px;">
                Yes; the painter must have been a pre-Raphaelite. No one but a 
                pre-Raphaelite would have painted, hair by hair, those feathery 
                masses of ringlets with every glimmer of gold, and every shadow 
                of pale brown. No one but a pre-Raphaelite would have so exaggerated 
                every attribute of that delicate face as to give a lurid lightness 
                to the blonde complexion, and a strange, sinister light to the deep 
                blue eyes. No one but a pre-Raphaelite could have given to that 
                pretty pouting mouth the hard and almost wicked look it had in portrait.<sup class="note"><a href="#note3">3</a></sup>   
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                As Braddon draws this portraiture of the novel’s namesake, the reader 
                can see this image come into view before them, and in the case of 
                <i>Lady Audley’s Secret</i>’s contemporary readers, would have had a 
                wealth of associations of Pre-Raphaelite portraiture “that they had 
                seen in galleries or in engraved reproductions in illustrated magazines 
                or papers”<sup class="note"><a href="#note4">4</a></sup> to help them 
                along in their imaginative reverie. Such a description forges an intimate 
                connection with the characterization of Lady Audley and the Pre-Raphaelite 
                tradition. More than just grounding the reader with reference of familiarity, 
                this invocation lays a great deal of groundwork for the development and 
                complexity of Lady Audley’s character, the tone of the portrait suggesting 
                that, far from an archetype of female villainy or idealism, Lady Audley 
                will fit neither pre-defined mold.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                The Pre-Raphaelites stressed the expression of “the idiosyncratic 
                uniqueness…instead of excluding ‘particularities,’ they accurately 
                displayed minute details—even ‘blemishes.’”<sup class="note"><a href="#note5">5</a></sup> 
                Though Lady Audley’s painting harkens to ideals of feminine beauty in the 
                “feathery masses of ringlets,” “the deep blue eyes,” and the “pretty pouting mouth,” 
                there remains a strangeness in the “lurid mass of color” and the 
                “ripe scarlet of the pouting lips.”<sup class="note"><a href="#note6">6</a></sup> 
                Indeed, it seems “that sometimes [the] painter is in a manner inspired, and 
                is able to see, through the normal expression of the face, another expression 
                that is equally a part of it, though not to be perceived by common eyes.”<sup class="note"><a href="#note7">7</a></sup> 
                Rather than suggest a binary nature of Lady Audley’s character, the 
                indecipherable peculiarity implies an intricacy to her nature, encouraged by 
                the “Pre-Raphaelite avant-garde gaze [which] revealed hitherto unexplored 
                perspectives as, for instance, unconventional beauty in conventional ugliness, 
                feminine fragility in masculinity, and masculine strength in conventional femininity.”<sup class="note"><a href="#note8">8</a></sup>

            <p>
                ‘Bocca Baciata’, by Dante Gabriel Rosetti was 
                completed in 1859 and was likely exhibited in 1860, a year before <i>Lady Audley’s Secret</i> 
                first started to appear in print. This is one candidate for an example portrait 
                against which readers could have associated Lady Audley’s painting. Other examples 
                include ‘Il Dolce far Niente’ by Holman Hunt, completed in 1859 as well. 
                Holman Hunt is, incidentally, mentioned explicitly in <i>Lady Audley’s Secret</i> 
                at a later point in the text:
            </p>
            <br />
            <p style="padding-left: 25px;">
                If Mr Holman Hunt could have peeped into the pretty boudoir, 
                I think the picture would have been photographed upon his brain 
                to be reproduced by-and-by upon a bishop’s half-length for the 
                glorification of the pre-Raphaelite brotherhood. My lady in that 
                half recumbent attitude, with her elbow resting on one knee, 
                and her perfect chin supported by her hand, the rich folds of 
                drapery falling away in long undulating lines from the exquisite 
                outline of her figure, and the luminous rose-coloured firelight 
                enveloping her in a soft haze, only broken by the golden glitter 
                of her yellow hair.<sup class="note"><a href="#note9">9</a></sup>
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                The connotation of Lady Audley with Pre-Raphaelite portraiture in 
                both the opening of the novel and here in its second volume, as well 
                as the fascination attributed to the contemplation of her character, 
                seen here in the narrator’s reflections and in the captivation her 
                portrait renders upon George Talboys and Robert Audley, encourage 
                the reader to carefully contemplate Lady Audley’s character. Such 
                deliberate attention intimates that, just as we think we know her, 
                a glimmer of the eye or a fold of the skirt may betray her intelligibility 
                and present something new.
