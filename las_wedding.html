            <p>
                One of the most striking junctures between Lady Audley’s story and 
                the social world of the London Journal’s pages occurs within its 
                organization alongside reports of the royal wedding of the Prince of Wales. 
                The wedding of the Prince of Wales to the Princess Alexandra of Denmark 
                took place on March 10, 1863, the details of which were extensively 
                covered in the pages of the periodical. Within this multitextual and 
                multipictorial setting, we are called to imagine “a reader who would 
                not only read the content of the journal in varied and layered ways 
                but also look at its images in differing and iterative installments.”<sup class="note"><a href="#note1">1</a></sup> 
                In fifth issue of <i>Lady Audley’s Secret</i>, published on  April 18, 1863, 
                the <i>London Journal</i> included a full page image of the royal presentation 
                jewelry, which they had already described in detail in previous issues. 
                In fact, the first four installments of <i>Lady Audley’s Secret</i>, which this 
                project reproduces, housed accompanying articles on the royal nuptials which 
                depicted its lavishness. This time, portrayed in an engraving, the dialogue 
                between Lady Audley’s story and the royal wedding are placed in visual conversation. 
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                The bridging of these contents’ boundaries creates a correlation between that 
                of Lady Audley’s attempted social ascension and the crown’s personification 
                of the aristocratic order. Elizabeth Andermann has discussed the conversations 
                which these two on-going subjects produced within the <i>London Journal</i>’s pages, 
                saying that when seen in combination with the reports of the royal wedding, 
                “Lady Audley stands as a reminder of the dangers of leaving one’s social class."<sup class="note"><a href="#note2">2</a></sup> 
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                As readers follow Helen Talboys to her evolution into governess, Lucy Graham, and 
                later into Lady Audley, mistress of Audley Court, they are reminded of her disastrous 
                attempt to ascend the social strata. The close proximity of Lady Audley’s tale to 
                descriptions of the royal family’s wealth seek to reify of class lines and their 
                inflexible limits. This world of excess, beauty, and extravagance, captured in the 
                depictions of Lady Audley’s person, her dress, and, especially, her private rooms 
                echoes that of the layered image of the royal jewels:
            </p>

                <img src="images/royal_jewels.png" alt="Royal wedding presentation jewels" width="900" height="100%"/>
                <figcaption id="illustration">The royal wedding presentation jewellery printed in the <i>London Journal</i>.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p style="padding-left: 25px;">
                The atmosphere of the room was almost oppressive from the rich odours of perfumes 
                in bottles whose gold stoppers had not been replaced…two or three handsome dresses 
                lay in a heap on the ground, and the open doors of a wardrobe revealed the treasures 
                within. Jewellery, ivory-backed hairbrushes, and exquisite china were scattered 
                here and there about the apartment.<sup class="note"><a href="#note3">3</a></sup>
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Unlike the careful, systematic organization of the royal jewelry image, Lady Audley’s 
                expensive possessions are strewn about half-hazard, suggesting her irresponsibility 
                and unfit nature to wield her newfound wealth. Just as Lady Audley’s aristocratic 
                marriage and name are revealed to be a false identity, one which Helen Talboys 
                cannot successfully assume, the contrasting nature of the presentation of 
                wealth from the neat and uniform royal jewels to Lady Audley’s messy handling 
                of her own riches seeks to emphasize that this world of abundance and luxury 
                is best left to those who were born to it.
