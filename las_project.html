            <h2>Reading Like the Victorians</h2>
        </header>
        <article>
            <p>
                For scholars of the Victorian novel, the realization that the bound 
                paper-back volumes through which we often encounter our texts belies 
                the conditions of their original printing has become somewhat common. 
                But, though this acknowledgement might be thought of as compulsory, 
                the engagement with such realities of textual production often falls 
                short, whether intentionally or not. Projects such as the 
                victorianserialnovels.org, headed by Robyn Warhol, and the 
                Victorian Reading Project at Stanford University have attempted to 
                pay close and sustained attention to the conditions of material production 
                and the climate of print culture during the nineteenth-century. Similarly, 
                this project, which locates itself under the object of 
                “reading like the Victorians,” takes special care to not only nod 
                to the original production of its texts or the literary environment 
                in which they circulated, but seeks to produce a reading experience 
                which allows for the contemplation of the periodical as a whole, understanding 
                this multivocal ecology as inextricable from the novel itself and redefining 
                our definitions of such “texts” in the process.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                This project operates under the knowledge that the serial novel was 
                “not…a text which was fixed between covers; rather…[it was] a novel 
                which was both emerging from the throes of composition and functioning 
                within the boundaries of a [periodical].”<sup class="note"><a href="#note1">1</a></sup> 
                Not only did the iterative format of the serial affect the composition process 
                and its function within the pages of a periodical, but it affected the ways 
                in which readers encountered and interacted with it. Such reading experiences 
                have been well-documented in their varieties by the likes of Catherine Delafield, 
                Laurel Brake, Mark Turner, Linda Hughes, Michael Lund, Emily Steinlight, 
                Mary Elizabeth Leighton, Lisa Surridge, and Elizabeth Andermann, among others.<sup class="note"><a href="#note2">2</a></sup> 
                Common to the work of these scholars is the understanding that the novel, 
                as it appeared to readers of the nineteenth-century, 
                “was not always a self-contained verbal entity but a reading process 
                [which was] embedded in a specific material framework that shaped response.”<sup class="note"><a href="#note3">3</a></sup> 
                Knowledge of this reading process is the impetus for this digital 
                project which sets out to recreate an environment of the historical 
                textual and contextual circumstances out of which the <i>London Journal</i> 
                serialization of <i>Lady Audley’s Secret</i> would have been born.
            </p>    
            <h2>The Serial Form of <i>Lady Audley's Secret</i></h2>
            <p>
                This project reconstructs an edition of <i>Lady Audley’s Secret</i> 
                as it appeared in its <i>London Journal</i> serialization from March to 
                August 1863. Instead of separating the iterations of Braddon’s novel 
                from the rest of the <i>London Journal</i> issue where they appeared, 
                this project creates the entire issue in its full, facsimile form. 
                In an attempt to recreate a reading process which is as faithful as 
                possible to its original format, the issues themselves are designed 
                in a flipbook style where the reader must go through each page of the 
                issue to reach the iteration of the novel in question. Though the 
                possibilities of the digital edition allow for technologies such as 
                hyperlinking and search to increase the ease through which readers 
                may access a given portion of text, this project specifically restricts 
                navigation to a page-by-page basis. By intentionally causing readers 
                to at least glance at each page as they flip through them, this edition 
                prompts a more accurate interaction of text and reader, attempting to 
                mirror the tangible process through which such periodicals would have 
                been navigated in their physicality.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                But, this project seeks to recreate more than simply the textual environment 
                of the periodical. It equally sets out to examine the contextual environment 
                of its 1863 readers. By providing accompanying commentary on the various 
                connections between the <i>Lady Audley’s Secret</i> and its contemporary touchstones, 
                the reader may approach the <i>London Journal</i>’s serial with a basic sense of 
                the novel’s milieu. To do this, the project focuses on the first four issues 
                of <i>Lady Audley’s Secret</i> appearing from March 21st, 1863 until 
                April 11th, 1863. The project provides a few carefully selected reference 
                points that embody the cultural setting in which readers would have encountered 
                Lady Audley and her story. These by no means exhaust the observations and 
                considerations which could be made between Braddon’s novel and its historical 
                backdrop, but do aim to represent a model for such connections and to create 
                positional framework through which readers can approach <i>Lady Audley’s Secret</i>, 
                reading, as Warhol says, “like Victorians” rather than 
                “to imagine we could read as Victorians.”<sup class="note"><a href="#note4">4</a></sup>
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                Of the many possibilities, this edition concerns itself with drawing out a 
                discussion of the relationship between <i>Lady Audley’s Secret</i> and the 
                wedding of the Prince of Wales to the Princess Alexandra of Denmark which 
                took place on March 10, 1863, the discourse of sensationalism and its 
                critique found in surrounding printed materials of the Victorian press, 
                reviews of <i>Lady Audley’s Secret</i> that coincided with the novel’s 
                <i>London Journal</i> serialization, and the ties between Lady Audley’s 
                characterization and the art of the Pre-Raphaelite movement. Further, 
                this edition also provides material on the particularities of illustration 
                that appear in this version of the novel by virtue of its 
                placement in the <i>London Journal</i>.
            </p>
            <h2>How to Use this Project</h2>
            <p>
                This project is designed to be read asynchronously. In order to mimic 
                a reading process that reflects the activity of the original audience 
                who would have “picked up installments randomly, skipped portions 
                they happened not to buy, stopped reading a novel halfway through,”<sup class="note"><a href="#note5">5</a></sup> 
                the reader is encouraged to move around the project capriciously, 
                experimenting with different ways of reading and associating the 
                project’s various materials. The home page provides access to all 
                pages of the site and acts as a starting point for exploration. 
                From this point of departure, the reader is given a variety of 
                navigational options that can be used at the reader’s discretion 
                to maneuver to different pages and to revisit others. The only 
                real sense of control placed upon the reader by the presentation 
                of the serialized content is the way the viewer must approach the 
                serialized text within the periodical space, the reasons for which 
                are described above. In this sense, there is no “right way” to go about 
                reading but, rather, the reader should go forth without expectation and 
                with the knowledge that their participation in ordering their own 
                experience will shape the way that this text comes into being. 
                Readers should feel encouraged to revisit this site and experiment 
                with different approaches to reading, concentrating their attention 
                on the ways in which these series of interactions and varieties of 
                encounter impose themselves upon their perception of <i>Lady Audley’s Secret</i>.
