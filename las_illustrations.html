            <p>
                Alongside the advancements in printing technology that allowed 
                the Victorian print market to flourish, there were simultaneous 
                strides being made in the world of illustration. New technologies 
                in engraving introduced a new era of illustrated fiction. From its 
                start in the 1820s as a marketing technique for booksellers, 
                the demand for illustrated fiction continued to grow, reaching 
                its height in the 1860s and leading to the ubiquitous presence 
                of images in magazines, newspapers, and novels.<sup class="note"><a href="#note1">1</a></sup>
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Thus, Victorian novel reading became inherently visual. The “surge of illustrated 
                material transformed Victorian print culture and reading practices as 
                illustration became central to both.”<sup class="note"><a href="#note2">2</a></sup> 
                This pervasiveness of visual material is none more starkly depicted than in the 
                installment novel. And, as this form was the most common method through 
                which Victorian readers approached many novels for the first time, 
                visuality became fundamental to their understanding of the work itself. 
                But, even for those who encountered illustrated copies secondarily to a 
                first reading, the prevalence of illustration and Victorian readers' familiarity 
                with it would have ensured they took notice of them. 
                The popularity of illustration often prompted a reissuance of novels either 
                in serial or volume form to satisfy the desires of the market. This is 
                the case of the illustrated version of <i>Lady Audley’s Secret</i> in 
                the <i>London Journal</i>, which this project takes as its subject. 
                However, more than just catering to the wishes of its readers, 
                the <i>London Journal</i>’s serialization of Braddon’s work performed 
                a vital function in the text's development. 
            </p>
            <h2>The Illustrated <i>Lady Audley's Secret</i></h2>
            <p>
                <i>Lady Audley’s Secret</i> has a complex publication history. 
                It first began serialization in 1891 on July sixth in the <i>Robin Goodfellow</i> 
                magazine and continued in installments until September twenty-eighth when the 
                publication folded. Only partially complete, the novel was reissued in the <i>Sixpenny Magazine</i> 
                from January to December of 1862, this time serialized in its entirety. 
                During the course of this second serialization, the novel was published in 
                three-volume format in October of 1862 for readers who could afford to access it. 
                The novel continued to be issued in subsequent editions, each time with various 
                emendations, additions, and deletions until its third “revised” edition, 
                which was used for all subsequent editions and for the novel's third serialization, 
                this time with accompanying illustrations, in the <i>London Journal</i>.<sup class="note"><a href="#note3">3</a></sup> 
                This twenty-two part, illustrated publication ran between March and August 1863 
                after sufficient demand from readers. Though Braddon’s story would have been 
                well-known to those who read it in the <i>London Journal</i>, whether by reputation 
                alone, its other serializations, published editions, or various theatrical adaptations 
                which began in 1862, the text of <i>Lady Audley’s Secret</i> was highly variable 
                and those who had access to the final, revised third edition would have been 
                limited in number compared to those who experienced Braddon’s story in its 
                first fluctuating formats. As such, the combination of both the stabilized, 
                “final" version of this text and the illustrated content present a first 
                encounter of sorts for the wide readership of the <i>London Journal</i> 
                who would have met Lady Audley as she has appeared since the novel was stabilized.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                This encounter was marked not only by its textual deviations from its original, 
                widely-dispersed forms in its first serialized editions and printings, 
                but for its inclusion of illustrations which were, like Leighton and Surridge 
                describe them, “<i>primary</i> because…images often came first in the reading process. 
                Victorian readers regularly saw illustrations before reading letterpress.”<sup class="note"><a href="#note4">4</a></sup> 
                And this is particularly true of the <i>London Journal</i>’s <i>Lady Audley’s Secret</i>, 
                which featured illustrations that formed the headings for many of its first 
                installments with accompanying captions that would characterize and 
                condition the reader’s contemplation of the subsequent issue. 
                This classifying function did not regulate itself to only those images 
                which directly related to the novel itself. In the case of serialized 
                novels, often appearing within the pages of a periodical or magazine, 
                these texts were equally influenced by their primary illustrations as 
                well as the illustrations which framed and surrounded their content.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                <i>The London Journal</i>’s serialization of <i>Lady Audley’s Secret</i> was run concurrently 
                with other illustrated installments including <i>The Woman in Black: Or Buried Alive</i> by Gordon Smythies, 
                <i>The Poor Girl</i> by Pierce Egan, and <i>Ida Lee: Or the Child of the Wreck</i> by Fairfax Balfour. 
                Sometimes, these illustrated texts even share a direct, tangible connection with <i>Lady Audley’s Secret</i>’s 
                illustration:
            </p>

                <img src="images/illustration_example.png" alt="Ajoining frontispieces for The Woman in Black and Lady Audley's Secret" width="900" height="100%"/>
                <figcaption id="illustration">The ajoining frontispieces for <i>The Woman in Black</i> and <i>Lady Audley's Secret</i>, published March 21, 1863.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <br />
            <p style="padding-left: 25px;">
                The first installment of <i>Lady Audley’s Secret</i> appears at the end of an installment 
                of <i>The Woman in Black</i>. The two serials meet on full pages at the center of the 
                magazine with the end of <i>The Woman in Black</i> on the left-hand page and the beginning 
                of <i>Lady Audley’s Secret</i> on the opposing page…Each incorporates an image that covers 
                the top third of the page above the two columns of text below. Because they face each other 
                and are similar in size, the two images seem to speak to one another…The layout encourages 
                readers to consider the relationship between the images.<sup class="note"><a href="#note5">5</a></sup>
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                More than just sharing a position within the center of the <i>London Journal</i>, these two 
                illustrations bare a remarkable resemblance in their contents. Both illustrations show a 
                departure: the first, of the Marquis and the second, of George Talboys. While one shows 
                the effects of this departure by the collapsed figure of Stella after her knowledge of the 
                Marquis disappearance, the other shows a sleeping figure, unconscious of the fleeing Talboys 
                who will eventually be known as Lady Audley. The juxtaposition of these two images forms something 
                of a foreshadowing for the novel. Visually, the two images mirror each other with the female 
                figures lying recumbent and the erect figures in motion appearing in opposite directions 
                as if they were mirrored, but where one suggests peace and ignorance in its central character, 
                the other reflects chaos and tragedy. Giving its readers a sense of the consequence of 
                Talboys departure, the <i>London Journal</i> places these two frontispieces in contiguity 
                as if <i>The Woman in Black</i> was indicative of the story to come.
            </p>
            <h2>The Visual Ecology of Periodicals</h2>
            <p>
                Mark Turner has described the nature of periodicals as 
                “multitextual and plural” showing how the very environment of the 
                periodical creates complex relationships between content, 
                not only forging a spatial connection between a page’s surroundings, 
                but a relationship of discourse, internally within the periodical 
                itself and externally within the world of its readers.<sup class="note"><a href="#note6">6</a></sup> 
                These connections brought about by the constitution of the periodical 
                and its intimate relationship with the everyday have particular applications 
                when it comes to the visuality of the periodical. For, the plurality of periodicals 
                are not only textual, they are visual, brought about by the interaction of various 
                illustration, both relating to fiction and non-fiction, creating a specific 
                type of visual ecology that is made out of their various placements and 
                associations. The term “ecology” is an apt descriptor for the type of 
                connections it describes. Highlighting the patterns of relation among 
                its various participants, ecology stresses the interrelation of its parts, 
                showing how its many participants shape one another by their situational placement 
                and correlational content. Such relationships are extant in the <i>London Journal</i>’s 
                serialization of <i>Lady Audley’s Secret</i> whose boundaries brush up against both 
                fiction and non-fiction, as well as various pieces of text and illustration, all which 
                participate in the construction of reader understanding.<sup class="note"><a href="#note7">7</a></sup>
