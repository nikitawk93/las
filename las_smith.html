                Of the many cultural references that surround <i>Lady Audley’s Secret</i>, 
                the 1857 trial of Madeline Smith resonates not only in its content—the two 
                cases both feature the murder, or attempted murder, of former love interests 
                in order to stifle their existence and ensure the success of their match 
                with a person of a higher social standing—but also in their evidence. 
                Like Lady Audley, Madeline Smith’s case was preoccupied with correspondence, 
                paper evidence, and its intelligibility. More than just the echo of an importance 
                placed on paper documentation, each were judged by the public on their toxic 
                textuality. Both Braddon’s novel and Smith’s “case, especially once it was printed 
                in the newspapers, w[ere] considered to be…equally dangerous “‘stor[ies].’”<sup class="note"><a href="#note1">1</a></sup>
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Having touched on the ubiquitous discourse of sensationalism,<sup class="note"><a href="#note2">2</a></sup> 
                the reader will be recall that the period of the 1860s was an “Age of Sensation,” 
                characterized by a preoccupation with scandal, violence, and spectacle of all forms. 
                This was especially apparent in the print culture of the decade which saw the rise 
                and resounding reign of sensation in journalism and fiction. These narratives had 
                much in common and, indeed, the sensation novel borrowed quite heavily from its 
                kinsman in print. In fact, much of what characterized this type of writing was the 
                blending of realism in its pages. Sensation fiction tended to be set in the familiar 
                spaces, usually occurring “in the otherwise prosaic, everyday, domestic setting of a 
                modern middle-class or aristocratic English household.”<sup class="note"><a href="#note3">3</a></sup> 
                This amalgamation of the ordinary and the outlandish caused a heightened 
                anxiety about the effects, and affects, of the public’s interest in 
                sensational stories, both fictive and real.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Madeline Smith was charged with and stood trial for the murder of her lover, 
                Emile L’Angelier, in 1857, just four years prior to <i>Lady Audley’s Secret</i>’s 
                first partial publication in the <i>Robin Goodfellow</i> magazine. Born to a prominent 
                Glasgow family, Smith’s trial shocked the British and Scottish public and was 
                widely discussed both in private homes and in newsprint. Smith and L’Angelier, 
                a man who was her senior in age but not in rank, began a clandestine affair 
                during which much correspondence passed between the two. Once Smith became 
                engaged to another man, she attempted to break off her relationship with L’Angelier 
                and asked for the return of her letters, but he refused and instead threatened to 
                expose her to her parents and to the public if she continued with her engagement 
                to William Minnoch. Soon after, L’Angelier became ill and died. The autopsy revealed the 
                cause to be arsenic poisoning and soon after, Smith, having been observed recently 
                purchasing the drug from a chemist, was charged with his murder. The trial commenced 
                on the thirtieth of June, 1857,<sup class="note"><a href="#note4">4</a></sup> but 
                “[b]ecuase Madeline Smith never took the stand…it was rather her letters that stood trial.”<sup class="note"><a href="#note5">5</a></sup>
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Smith’s letters were critiqued in much the same manner as other forms of sensationalism 
                and were deemed obscene for their sexually explicit content. Accusations of depravity, 
                spectacle, guilt, and indecency were launched at their contents—they were “‘mental pollution’”<sup class="note"><a href="#note6">6</a></sup> 
                much like those novels which “softened the brain.”<sup class="note"><a href="#note7">7</a></sup> 
                The textual focus of this trial, though unable to prove Smith’s guilt, did not 
                escape the scrutiny of the press and public. She was given a verdict of “Not Proven,” 
                “an acquittal with the same effect as ‘not guilty’” but its meaning “is closer to 
                ‘we think you did it, but the prosecution couldn’t prove it’.”<sup class="note"><a href="#note8">8</a></sup> 
                Like Lady Audley, Smith’s case rested upon a collection of “paper objects not 
                just as texts but also as things, as matter occupying space and persisting through time.”<sup class="note"><a href="#note9">9</a></sup> 
                Though the accumulation of both of these textual archives, in the case of Smith’s 
                letters and in the fragments of Lady Audley’s identity as Lucy Graham, do not prove 
                the guilt of either person, their collection and constant presence, in newsprint 
                and in Robert Audley’s pocket-book and pigeon-hole repositories, create a dialogue 
                which surrounds their figures as if in a fog, ensuring their disappearance. This disappearance 
                is two-fold. In one sense, each recede into the textual environment of their stories 
                and take on an other-worldly notoriety as villainesses of the most sensational nature, 
                carrying an implied guilt, both saved by the indistinguishability of their paper evidence 
                and simultaneously convicted by it.<sup class="note"><a href="#note10">10</a></sup> 
                In the other, each character literally disappears. Lady Audley is committed to 
                a <i>maison de sante</i> in Belgium and Smith is committed to an asylum of a different nature, 
                self-imposed and under a new name in a new country.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                The infamy of Smith’s trial would have virtually ensured the readers of <i>Lady Audley’s Secret</i>’s familiarity. 
                But even so, the explicit connections between the two stories and their embodiment of 
                the sensationalism that exploded in the print culture leading up to and during the 1860s 
                marks a certain kind of resemblance between these two stories and their very “writerly” natures. 
                Much of the public’s distrust of Smith and their assurance that she was guilty 
                were premised upon her ability to pen sensationally-charged letters. Braddon and her story 
                were subject to the same distrust, the same charges of culpability in the public poisoning of the mind 
                that this type of sensationalism supposedly wrought. As such, the legacies of Smith’s trial reaches 
                out beyond its “not proven” verdict. Participating in a dialogue which branched across the 
                lives of real and fictive characters, Lady Audley’s and Madeline Smith’s stories form 
                the sensational female archetype in the mind of the public and on the print of the page.

Similarly, though Robert Audley finds evidence enough to prove that Lady Audley was guilty of deception by way of his recovery of paper scraps, these clues alone never form a link strong enough to prove her culpability in the disappearance of George Talboys.</sup></p>
