            <h2>Conversations in Print Culture</h2>
            <p>
                The nature of novel publishing during the later nineteenth-century 
                was such that some novels would see volume publications released 
                before their serialized components were fully complete. As such, 
                there was an opportunity for reviews to be published during the process 
                of serialization. Often, these reviews mark the appearance of a 
                particular kind of conversation in the culture of print which surrounds 
                and interjects itself upon the text that remains in-process. Looking 
                to these moments reveals the living existence of a text within the 
                social world of its inhabitance in particular ways. By the time <i>Lady Audley’s Secret</i> 
                was appearing in iterative form in the <i>London Journal</i>, it had 
                already been partially and fully serialized, as well as introduced 
                in volume form. Due to these conditions, the <i>London Journal</i>’s 
                serialization coincided with the simultaneous publication of various 
                reviews which built a commentary around Lady Audley and her story.
            </p>
            <h2><i>The London Review.</i></h2>
            <h3>April 11, 1863</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/madame_de_brinvilliers.png" alt="Madame de Brinvilliers" width="450" height="100%">
                <br />
                <figcaption id="illustration"><p>Madame de Brinvilliers, a French noblewoman accused of</p><p>murder with whom Lady Audley is compared.</p></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                One such example comes from <i>The London Review</i>, 
                which was published on the same day as the third installment 
                of the <i>London Journal</i>’s serialization of <i>Lady Audley’s Secret</i>. 
                The article, entitled “The Romance of Wicked Women,” begins with a 
                declaration of the startling success that has accompanied 
                the publication, and subsequent editions, of <i>Lady Audley’s Secret</i>. 
                The cause of which is attributed to a general excitement brought on 
                “by the delineation of female guilt.”<sup class="note"><a href="#note1">1</a></sup> 
                This “morbid feeling…to pry into the dark recesses of those feminine natures which, 
                by their own inherent wickedness, or by the pressure of cruel circumstance, 
                have attained [a] degree of reckless ferocity.”<sup class="note"><a href="#note2">2</a></sup> 
                Going on to list notorious female characters from a wide range of literature, 
                poetry, and theatrical production, this review enters into a discussion on 
                the philosophical nature of the public’s interest in the wickedness displayed 
                by the story’s central character, drawing a map of intertextual relationships 
                that have arisen throughout the process of the reviewer’s reading and 
                subsequent contemplation of the novel. Lady Audley is equated with 
                female archetypes in Lady Macbeth, through the character’s recent 
                representations by actresses “Mrs. Siddons, and…Madame Ristori” who have 
                "made so great an impression on the English public,” and Lucrezia Borgia.<sup class="note"><a href="#note3">3</a></sup> 
                She is further compared to Madame de Brinvilliers, Madeleine Smith,<sup class="note"><a href="#note4">4</a></sup> 
                and Mrs. Manning—all real-life murderesses with sensational stories<sup class="note"><a href="#note5">5</a></sup> 
                that juxtapose the reviewer’s understanding of Lady Audley with contemporary 
                touchstones, showing the intricacies between Victorian reader’s encounter with 
                the serialized novel and their daily life. 
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                By relating <i>Lady Audley’s Secret</i> with the works of Shakespeare, 
                the crimes of Madame de Brinvilliers, and other depictions of actual 
                women committing atrocities of the same caliber as Lady Audley, 
                the review places the novel in conversation with these points of reference, 
                guiding the characterizations with which readers categorize Lady Audley 
                and her story. These threads of dialogue posit certain “meaning and shape” 
                for the novel, emerging from “a particular historical moment in a socially 
                specific environment.”<sup class="note"><a href="#note6">6</a></sup> 
                Taking note of these associative relationships can give us a model of 
                the ways in which readers mediated their understanding of the text 
                alongside their lived experiences and allow us to see the ways in which 
                the novel, and especially the serialized novel, participates in a culture 
                of associations. Such associations are especially pronounced for those 
                novels which emerged within the periodical space, both creating 
                connections between itself and the content of the publication’s pages 
                and with other printed materials that surrounded its continued emergence 
                in the on-going nature of installment publication. Throughout its lifespan, 
                the serial novel had a special and sustained version of this dialogue that 
                created distinctive relationships by proxy of its placement in the very 
                center of a culture of print.
